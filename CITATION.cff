  This paper addresses the challenge of solving recursive
  domain equations in Coq for type constructors with
  multiple arguments that appear in both positive and
  negative positions. Existing frameworks primarily focus on
  type constructors with a single argument, limiting their
  applicability to more complex scenarios. While the
  theoretical foundation for solving such equations with
  multiple arguments has been established, specific proof
  details for the general case are missing. This work
  bridges that gap by providing a comprehensive
  formalization in Coq. Our formalization is based on the
  category of ordered families of equivalences (OFEs) and
  non-expansive functions, a widely adopted and practical
  model for guarded recursion. This choice enhances the
  relevance and applicability of our contributions to
  ongoing research and projects in the field.
